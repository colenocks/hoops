A basketball shooting game
This HTML5 canvas based game was developed as a little tribute to the Basketball legend, Kobe Bryant as well as his daughter and all who lost their lives on the 26th of january 2020.

The game simulates throwing a ball into the hoop to score a point just as with the basketball sport. The player sets the angle and speed/velocity of the ball with the controls at the below the canvas or the keyboard and shoots as many shots until the time runs out.

This is also much similar to the basketball game found in some casinos or indoor entertainment centers like leisureplex. 

The application implements the aspects of physics (kinematics) such as collision, velocity, angles, coefficient of restitution, tunnelling etc using the popular formulars of motion, acceleration and pythagorem's theorem.
